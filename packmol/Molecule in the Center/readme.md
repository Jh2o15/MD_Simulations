## Overview
In this project we aim to study the polarization/influence produced by a molecule of glutamine. 

Therefore, we need glutamine.pdb, tip3.pdb 

This geometry is simple and its given by ***in.configuration_fixed_center***, which need to be run with packmole. The topology file is ***solvate.tcl*** which is imcomplete and probably wrong. The lammp simulation also need to be done
## Important
This project is incomplete, The tcl file and the lammstrj needs to be generated too.

We need to study how to generate the topology file for a set up with more a system with different types of molecules.

We need to confirm that the force produced by the glutamine molecule is given by coulumb and lj interactions

We need to study how to determine the correct lj coefficientes between molecules for acurracy.
