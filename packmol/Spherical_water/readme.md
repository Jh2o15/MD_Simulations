This project explores how to generate geometric configurations using packmol. 
In particular, we generate a shield of urea with water on its inside and outside. No dynamics are implemented in this work.
As raw materials we are using water(tip3.pdb) and urea(urea.pdb) both model of molecules are generated from Charmm-GUI
