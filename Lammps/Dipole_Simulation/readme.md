## Overview ## 
In this folder we are including different types of simulations for dipoles, with different parameteres. 
We wanto to simulate particles with randomly oriente dipole moments and see how its dipole moment get aligned with an electric field. So far we are considering a constant electric field.

  *in.dipoles_simple_small: Randomly oriente dipoles on a box
  *in.dipoles_simple_E_constant_slow: Randomly oriente dipoles in a box, with a constant electric field on z-axis
